  # Typing simulation (user input)
  typing_delay_per_char: 0.1    # Delay per character (seconds)
  typing_delay_variance: 0.05    # Random variance in typing speed

  # Delays between events
  pause_after_input: 0.5         # Pause after user enters text
  output_delay: 1.0              # Delay before showing LLM output (thinking time)

  # LLM streaming simulation with realistic variable delays
  # Chunks are variable-sized (1-10 chars) with highly variable delays:
  # - Fast bursts: 0.01-0.03s (40% of chunks)
  # - Normal speed: chunk_delay Â± 30% (35% of chunks)
  # - Slow processing: 2-3x chunk_delay (20% of chunks)
  # - Brief pauses: 4-6x chunk_delay (5% of chunks)
  chunk_delay: 0.1             # Base delay for normal speed chunks
